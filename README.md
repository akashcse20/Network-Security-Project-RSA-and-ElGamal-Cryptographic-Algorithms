# Network-Security-Project-RSA-and-ElGamal-Cryptographic-Algorithms
This project implements RSA and ElGamal cryptographic algorithms for key generation, encryption, and decryption. It also explores ElGamal with Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). Performance metrics, including execution times for key operations, are provided for efficiency analysis.
